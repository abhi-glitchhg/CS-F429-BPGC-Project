Project Topic - Syntax Analysis in Source Code

Problem Statement -

Part 1: All programming languages have a distinct grammar that has to be adhered to for compilation and execution. This
arrangement is then used by the parser to compile a program.
IF ’(’ expression ’)’ statement ELSE statement
statement ELSE statement
For the above 2 statements the 2nd line is syntactically incorrect because of the absence of a preceding ‘if’ statement.
Design a parser which is able to determine if a code snippet is syntactically correct.
Part 2: Intelligent code completion is a context-aware code completion feature in some programming environments that speeds
up the process of coding applications by reducing typos and other common mistakes.
